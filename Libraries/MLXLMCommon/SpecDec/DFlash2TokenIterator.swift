// DFlash 2 speculative decode loop.
//
// Port target: `_stream_generate` in z-lab/dflash `dflash/model_mlx.py`,
// adapted to this package's ``TokenIteratorProtocol`` and to hybrid
// targets whose recurrent layers cannot be trimmed.
//
// Shape of one cycle:
//
//   1. Build the block `[anchor, mask, mask, …]` (block_size entries).
//   2. ONE drafter forward emits candidates for every masked position;
//      the selector traces a coherent path through them. That path is
//      `block_size - 1` draft tokens.
//   3. ONE target forward over `[anchor] + drafts` verifies all of them
//      and, as a side effect, produces the hidden states the drafter
//      will condition on next round.
//   4. Accept the longest agreeing prefix, append the target's own token
//      at the divergence, roll the target cache back to the accepted
//      length.
//
// Rollback on a hybrid target is the part the reference solves
// differently. `model_mlx.py` monkey-patches GatedDeltaNet to capture its
// inputs and recomputes the recurrent state over the accepted prefix.
// This package already had to solve the same problem for native MTP, and
// the solution there is better: the recurrent layers RECORD their state
// at each step of the verify forward, so committing the accepted prefix
// is a dictionary lookup rather than a recomputation. That machinery is
// reused verbatim here — see `MambaCache.commitRecordedPrefix`.
