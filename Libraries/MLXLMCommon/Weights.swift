    /// text-only model in the VLM key layout leaves the body — or, in the wild, just the output head —
    /// under `language_model.*`, while the text model binds its modules at the top level. Loading such
    /// a bundle otherwise fails with `Unhandled keys [language_model]`. Being tolerant here is
    /// deliberate: refusing to load a bundle someone already downloaded is worse than absorbing the
    /// artifact.
    ///
    /// Both spellings are handled: `model.language_model.foo` → `model.foo`, and
    /// `language_model.foo` → `foo`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - weights: the checkpoint keys, as loaded.
    ///   - only: when non-`nil`, only keys whose **stripped** form begins with one of these strings are
    ///     rewritten; every other key passes through untouched. Use it when a checkpoint is known to
    ///     misplace exactly one module (e.g. `only: ["lm_head."]`) so the strip cannot silently absorb
    ///     an unrelated, genuine `language_model.*` key. `nil` strips wherever the prefix appears.
    /// - Returns: the weights with the prefix removed.
    ///
    /// ## Collisions are resolved deterministically
    ///
    /// A mixed-provenance re-bake can carry **both** spellings of a key — a converter writes the
    /// prefixed head while something upstream leaves the unprefixed one behind. Both then want the same
    /// destination. Resolving that by last-write-wins would make the bind depend on `Dictionary`'s
    /// iteration order, which is **seeded per process**: the model would silently load a different
    /// tensor from run to run. That is the worst failure shape available — it loads fine, generates
    /// fine-ish, and is wrong some fraction of the time.
    ///
    /// So: an unprefixed key already sitting at the destination always wins, and any remaining tie is
    /// broken by lexicographically smallest source key. The choice is arbitrary but *fixed*; the point
    /// is that it never varies between runs. Losing keys are logged.
