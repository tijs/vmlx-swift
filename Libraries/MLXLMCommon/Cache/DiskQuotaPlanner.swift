/// Vocabulary. A **chain** is every non-stable, non-legacy row sharing a
/// `chainId`; a row with `chainId == nil` is a chain of one. A chain's **tip**
/// is its row with the greatest `tokenCount` (ties: greatest recency, then
/// greatest `id`). **Chain recency** is the greatest recency among its rows.
/// The **active** chain is the one named by `activeChain`; every other chain
/// is **cold**. `low = Int64(Double(cap) * lowWatermarkFraction)`.
///
/// The policy:
///
/// 1. `total <= cap`: nothing. The trigger is the CAP, not the low watermark.
/// 2. **Oversized first.** A row with `bytes > cap` can never fit and goes
///    before anything else, so the best prior prefix that does fit is not
///    sacrificed to make room for it. If it is the active chain's tip the
///    plan carries `.activeTipDropped`. If the total now fits the cap the pass
///    STOPS: an oversized row is no reason to chase the low watermark. Tips
///    and chain recency below are taken over the rows that survive this step,
///    so a chain whose newest snapshot was oversized keeps its best fitting
///    one as its resume point.
/// 3. **Soft phase,** paid only with rows that are not a resume point:
///    (a) legacy companions, oldest first, down to `low`; (b) non-tip rows of
///    cold chains, coldest chain first, smallest `tokenCount` first within a
///    chain, down to `low`; (c) non-tip rows of the active chain, smallest
///    `tokenCount` first, down to the CAP only. Each step stops as soon as
///    its goal is met, or when it runs out of such rows.
///
///    Why (c) stops at the cap: the conversation in progress is about to read
///    its own resume boundaries again — an edit restores from an older one,
///    and a regenerate lands on the newest (it is the prompt minus the
///    assistant header, so the exact-prompt row buys only those few tokens).
///    Spending them on hysteresis trades a certain re-prefill now for fewer
///    evicting passes later. Cold chains' superseded rows have no such reader.
///    A marked chain's unmarked rows (exact prompt, post-answer) are spent
///    before any of that and are not pressure; a row that a hit lands on is
///    marked from then on, so each template keeps the row it really reuses.
/// 4. **Hard phase, only while `total > cap`:** (d) cold chains' tips, coldest
///    chain first; (e) stable roots, oldest first; (f) the active chain's tip,
///    last. Stops as soon as `total <= cap`.
///
/// Why tips never pay for hysteresis: a tip is a conversation's resume point,
/// and losing it costs a full cold prefill of that conversation. The low
/// watermark only buys fewer evicting passes; that is worth legacy companions
/// and cold conversations' superseded snapshots, and nothing more. And why the stable root yields before the
/// active tip: for the conversation in progress the tip is a superset prefix
/// of the stable root, so the root saves nothing the tip does not.
///
/// (f) is the end of the order rather than a step that runs: by then every
/// other row is gone and a tip that survived step 2 fits the cap on its own.
///
/// 5. If a row of the active chain went in (c) or (f) and the tip was not
///    already reported dropped, the plan carries `.activeChainTrimmed` with
///    the bytes of the active tip as it was before the pass. Evicting only
///    cold, legacy or stable rows is not an event.
/// 6. The plan does not depend on the order of `rows`: every ordering below
///    is total and ends on `id`.
/// 7. A cache migrated from the old schema — every `chainId` nil, no stable
///    roots, no active chain — has no superseded rows to find: every row is a
///    tip, the soft phase has no KV row to take, and (d) is oldest recency
///    first to exactly the cap. With no legacy companions that is the old
///    order exactly, oversized-first included. With legacy companions it is
///    the old order plus hysteresis on them alone: both policies take legacy
///    companions first, oldest first, but the old one stopped at the cap and
///    (a) goes on to `low`. The KV rows evicted are never more than the old
///    policy's; the legacy companions evicted are never fewer.
