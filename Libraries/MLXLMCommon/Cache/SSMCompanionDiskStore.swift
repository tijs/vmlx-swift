// §441 — SSMCompanionDiskStore (native port of Python vmlx_engine #110).
//
// In-memory `SSMStateCache` (companion cache for hybrid Mamba+attention
// models — NemotronH / Cascade-2 / Nemotron-Omni / Qwen3.5-A3B / Jamba)
// is fast but volatile: a process restart re-prefills the prompt from
// scratch even if the user's system prompt + first turn haven't
// changed. For stable-system-prompt workloads (Terminal mode with a
// fixed scope-flagged agent prompt, server-side chat with one canonical
// system message) this re-prefill costs O(prompt_len) on every cold
// start.
//
// This store mirrors `DiskCache.swift`'s pattern: hash-keyed
// safetensors files under a flat directory, JSON sidecar for
// `is_complete` flag (parity with Python's `(states, is_complete)`
// tuple semantics from `vmlx_engine/utils/ssm_companion_cache.py`).
//
// Storage format per entry:
//   <cacheDir>/ssm-<sha>.safetensors    — N MLX arrays keyed `state_0`…`state_N-1`
//   <cacheDir>/ssm-<sha>.json           — metadata { is_complete, num_states, model_key }
//
// Cache key derivation delegates to the in-memory `SSMStateCache.makeKey`
// implementation so model key and media salt isolation cannot drift between
// memory and disk companion caches.
//
// Concurrency: store/fetch/clear are serialized with an
// `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`, and MLX safetensors IO also takes
// `MLXDiskCacheIOLock.shared` so companion-state reads/writes cannot overlap
// KV-cache safetensors reads/writes from another resident model. MLX tensor
// realization and safetensors IO should not overlap, and the metadata sidecar
// must stay paired with the tensor file.
//
// Wired by `CacheCoordinator` when `CacheCoordinatorConfig.enableDiskCache`
// is true. `SSMStateCache.store` write-throughs here and `fetchEntry`
// falls through on memory miss, using the same model key and media salt
// isolation as the KV tiers.
